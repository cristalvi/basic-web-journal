                                            Friday night I finally got Evan to meet me&#44; and it was a strange sort of night. Of course I was early and he was late&#44; but that was ok. He was really nice. I did have to drive very far&#44; but it really wasn&#39;t a big deal. We hung out and talked&#44; went for breakfast and talked some more&#44; and spent just as much time sitting in my car talking and <em>not</em> talking. Strangely&#44; it was a great time.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            We had arranged to go out again on Monday morning&#44; when he wasn&#39;t exhausted. That morning we met up by the Space Needle and went for coffee. After&#44; we drove to Lynnwood to browse at Guitar Center. I was enjoying myself&#33; Then&#44; <em>again</em>&#44; we sat in his truck talking for a long time. We talked about just about everything. He even &#39;bought me a rock&#39;&#33; Now that&#39;s another story&#33;
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The next day was <em>extremely</em> tough for me. In the middle of texting Evan&#44; I get a message from Michael. I knew it was comming&#44; but of course I don&#39;t want to think about him. He crushed me and I still don&#39;t think I&#39;m over that. I&#39;d rather think about Evan&#44; but I&#39;m not sure if his motivations are the same as mine. That worries me.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I had to think a lot yesterday about everything that has happened in my relationships&#44; and the way I handle it. Not well&#44; I think&#44; for the most part. I can&#39;t seem to get through the infatuation phase without ruining myself. My actions are complete opposite of what they should be&#44; to get the outcome I want. I know this&#44; but just can&#39;t seem to get around it. I really have no patience when it comes to relationships and what I want.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            More often than not my emotions consume my thoughts and leave me paralized&#44; unable to move my life forward. I neglect the rest of my life&#44; and the people in it. The problem this time is that I <strong>really</strong> like Evan...so far...and want it to work out for once in my life&#33;
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Maybe if I slow myself down. I should act slowly and take things for what they are. Stop and think about what is happening. Consider what I am doing and why. Consider what the other person is going through and what they are actually doing in response to that. I should stop thinking about what might be and keep my mind in the present. I need to stop reading past what&#39;s in front of my eyes&#59; get out of my head for once. If only it were so easy...I need help&#33;
                                        </p>
