                                            Dustin and I had a great time talking over coffee. I was so nervous&#44; but it went well. There was something about him. We decided to go on a second date on Friday. I was not sure what to expect. I think I was more nervous for that date than our first meeting.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Our first date was at Bahama Breeze in Southcenter. He actually picked me up and drove&#44; which was nice. I wasn&#39;t sure how that would go. It was pretty busy when we got there&#44; but luckily we got a couple of seats at the bar. He was pretty intent on making this a &#39;buy a bottle of wine&#39; kind of event. So we drank and talked. It was really nice.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            When he told me about his idea to drive to his buddy&#39;s house&#44; I wasn&#39;t sure what to think. Did he want a second opinion...you know...a friend&#39;s approval&#63; Plus it was <em>so</em> far away. The drive went by quick enough. We did have to stop and pick up another bottle of wine and a corkscrew&#44; though. His friend was nice enough. Good guy. Kind of goofy&#44; but good guy. It was nice to gradually get closer to Dustin. We played pool and had some laughs. All in all&#44; a good time.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Afterwards&#44; he came back to my place where...I guess you could say...I had my way with him&#33; OH MY GOD was it fun&#44; and <strong>good</strong>&#33; I swear he is <em>so</em> perfect for me. How is that possible&#63; It seams like we immediately just fell into this grove. It&#39;s wonderfull&#33; Not to mention the next day&#44; I was on my lunch break&#44; thinking I was seeing his car everywhere&#44; when he texted me. I had a feeling he was doing something...and wouldn&#39;t you know it&#44; he came to my work to surprise me&#33; He stayed for a few AND bought me a rose&#33; In one fell swoop&#44; he did the two things that I have been wanting someone to do for me for over six years. He&#39;s perfect. That&#39;s all there is to it.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I really hope he is the one for me. I feel like myself around him. I am totally crazy about him right now. He seems like a nice person and I don&#39;t think he would hurt me like the others...but what do I know. I also thought that about ALL of the others too. Maybe he is the right one. We will see.
