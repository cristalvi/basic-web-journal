                                      Things have started to settle in&#44; a bit. The quiet points between our conversations are growing. I know he&#39;s got things swimming around in his head. I can see it on his face. Nothing has really changed between us yet. We still talk. Lately&#44; we&#39;ve been talking about living together. He calls it the next step in our relationship. Maybe it is&#44; maybe not.

                                      So last night was really hard. I kept thinking of Dustin&#44; of course&#44; and started thinking of things that got me really scared. I have been in my <em>hormonal</em> state&#44; lately&#44; which really bothers me. I don&#39;t know if I'm being stupid or if it is really rational&#44; sensible thinking. I told him I love him&#44; which <em>always</em> changes things&#44; and now I think I'm freaking out a bit.

                                      So&#44; I have met Dustin&#39;s Mom. She is a very interesting lady. It makes sense that she is a Capricorn like me. I was very impressed hearing about all of the things she has gone through in her life. I wish I was as strong as her. I can only hope. It gives me a little hope for a future between me and Dustin knowing that he was born from a lady like her.

I never feel threatened or uncomfortable when I&#39;m close to him. Not once. That&#39;s good right&#63;

                                      Dustin and I had a great time talking over coffee. I was so nervous&#44; but it went well. There was something about him. We decided to go on a second date on Friday. I was not sure what to expect. I think I was more nervous for that date than our first meeting.
