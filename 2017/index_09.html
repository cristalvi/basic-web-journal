                                      Well, shit. Yesterday was the most frustratng day I've had in a while. I could not, for the life of me, get my stupid computer to update. It took all day, and I had to end up restoring it anyway. Then I thought I lost what I had posted the day before, so I rewrote it, but ended up finding the page I wrote after <em>finally</em> updating my computer anyway! How rediculous is that!

                                      This morning was very upsetting. The night before, I had asked Michael to call me so that we could talk, and he did. We had a very awkward conversation, where I told him what was bugging me and where he avoided talking to me. He said very little about <em>why</em> this was going the way it was, and just when I thought I'd get some answers, he said he had to get off the phone to take Nathan's temperature. Then 'click'...he was gone.

                                      Through all of the emotional uphieval, I am trying to find my roots again. I want to be someone stronger and more grounded in who I really am. I'm taking small steps at a time but I feel like the loneliest person in the city.

                                      Michael won't talk to me. It doesn't make much sense to me. Ever since he got back we haven't spent much time together, even talking. He got sick and now only texts me after I text first. When he does, I get short and sweet messages. It's absolutely frustrating. I can't tell how he feels.

                                      So, I think I need to make an adjustment in my life. I don't want to lose sight of who I am, and right now I feel as lost as ever. Every time I go about being alone, but then have the opportunity to make a connection with someone, I freak out.
