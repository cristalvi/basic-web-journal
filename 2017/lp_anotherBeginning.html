                                        <p>  <!-- What do you want to say? -->
                                            This morning was very upsetting. The night before, I had asked Michael to call me so that we could talk, and he did. We had a very awkward conversation, where I told him what was bugging me and where he avoided talking to me. He said very little about <em>why</em> this was going the way it was, and just when I thought I'd get some answers, he said he had to get off the phone to take Nathan's temperature. Then 'click'...he was gone.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            He also mentioned that he was going through some stuff, but was not telling me anything. He said he was not really talking to anyone else either, and did not really go into anything more. I had asked him to call me back, but he never did. Instead he went out to the park with his son, but told me they were laying down. He never called back later. I got a text after a few hours though. He left me hanging, maybe to get back at me, I don't know. I don't understand what he is trying to accomplish.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I <em>do not</em> understand. It makes no sense to me what happened between us. Is he mad because I did not text him for a day? Is he truly blowing me off because he <em>is</em> that much of an asshole? Is he really busy, sick, off his normal behavior, and I should just let him recover himself? All I know is that I am hurting on the inside. I am hurting and he does not seem to care.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I know I am chasing my tail now. I keep looking for something that I want in a place where I don't think it can be. The love that I want, and the comfort and safety that I crave, I don't think I will ever find in a man. I think I need to keep God in my mind and in my heart, especially if I want to feel those things. I need to be the best me I can be for myself, not for anyone or anything else.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I'm not sure how to be with Michael. I don't know what to do other than be me, honest and truthful. I don't know whether or not to be happy, or angry, or scared, or feel nothing, or something else. I don't know what to do. I <em>don't know</em> what happened. <strong>I do know it's over.</strong> If he wanted me, he would try to make things work. If he wanted to talk, we would. If he cared about my feelings, and how much this is hurting me (because he knows this is bothering me), he would do something about it. He doesn't care how I feel. He was just using me. I thought he was the one person for me. I thought he would be the man I would share the rest of my life with. He was perfect. He had everything I was looking for...but it was not real. He is not the man I think he is. He is not worthy of having my heart.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            What is wrong with me? How can I trust any man again? Everytime I feel like I have found something special, it fades into something sad, and I never see the problem. I always see the end coming in some way, eventually, but it always starts off feeling so perfect. I can't tell what's right anymore.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            My heart is broken again. The person I thought was the one person for me is gone. I know what I want, but is there no one out there like that who wants me back?
                                        </p>
