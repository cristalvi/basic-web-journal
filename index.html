                                    </div>  
                                    <p>
                                        Well, shit. Yesterday was the most frustratng day I've had in a while. I could not, for the life of me, get my stupid computer to update. It took all day, and I had to end up restoring it anyway. I lost what I had posted the day before, so here is a recap of that....
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Basically, it said that the morning was hard. I had asked Michael to call me so we could talk, and he did. Then he said very little about why this was going the way it was. And just when I thought I'd get some answers, he said he had to go check Nathan's temperature, and 'click'...he was gone.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I had asked him to call me back, but he never did. He went out to the park with his son, but told me they were laying down, and never called. I got a text a few hours later though. He left me hanging, maybe to get back at me, I don't know. I don't understand what he is trying to accomplish.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I don't know what to do. I don't know what happened. I do know it's over. If he wanted me, he would try to make things work. If he wanted to talk, we would. If he cared about my feelings, and how much this is hurting me (because he knows this is bothering me), he would do something about it. He doesn't care how I feel. He was just using me. I thought he was the one person for me. I thought he would be the man I would share the rest of my life with. He was perfect. He had everything I was looking for...but it was not real. He is not the man I think he is. He is not worthy of having my heart.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        What is wrong with me? How can I trust any man again? Everytime I feel like I have found something special, it fades into something sad, and I never see the problem. I always see the end coming in some way, eventually, but it always starts off feeling so perfect. I can't tell what's right anymore.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        My heart is broken again. The person I thought was the one person for me is gone. I know what I want, but is there no one out there like that who wants me back?
                                    </p>

                                        Through all of the emotional uphieval, I am trying to find my roots again. I want to be someone stronger and more grounded in who I really am. I'm taking small steps at a time but I feel like the loneliest person in the city.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Michael won't talk to me. It doesn't make much sense to me. Ever since he got back we haven't spent much time together, even talking. He got sick and now only texts me after I text first. When he does, I get short and sweet messages. It's absolutely frustrating. I can't tell how he feels.
                                    </p>

                                        So, I think I need to make an adjustment in my life. I don't want to lose sight of who I am, and right now I feel as lost as ever. Every time I go about being alone, but then have the opportunity to make a connection with someone, I freak out.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I push and push and drive myself crazy. I so want every opportunity to BE THE ONE that I get so disappointed when things don't go perfectly. Then I make some sort of stupid little mistake that almost ruins everything.
                                    </p>
